# Pascal's Triangle

## About me

Hi! I am Pascal's Triangle.

I don't mean to sound arrogant or cocky, but I am a mathematical treasure trove,
and I am full of cool patterns and secrets.

Please, let me show you some of my tricks ;)

## What do you need?

I was made with Python 3.7.7 but any version of Python 3 should work.

## How to run me?

In a terminal, run:

```
python3 pascal.py
```

## What can I do?

For now, I can create a visualisation of Pascal's triangle based on the size your
terminal has when running the program.

## Possible improvements

In future versions I will show you some of my cool secrets, like my connections
to:
 - Fractals and the Sierpinski’s Triangle
 - Fibonnacci series
 - Triangular numbers
 - Tetrahedral 
 - Prime numbers

## Interesting fact about my name and history

I am mostly known in the western world as Pascal's Triangle, after French
mathematician Blaise Pascal (1623-1162), due to the patterns he discovered in
me.

However, I am much much older!

Some of my other artistic names include:
- "Staircase of Mount Meru" in India
- "Khayyam Triangle" in Iran, after Omar Khayyam (1048–1131)
- "Yang Hui's Triangle" in China, after Yang Hui (ca. 1238–1298)
- "Tartaglia's Triangle" in Italy, after Niccolò Fontana 'Tartaglia' (1501-1557)
